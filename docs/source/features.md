# Key Features

```{include} ../../README.md
:start-after: <!-- features -->
:end-before: <!-- .features -->
```

Some of the features are described in more detail below.

## Mixing MD and RST

The template configures Sphinx to mix writing in Markdown and reStructuredText syntax freely. The detection is based on the `.md` or `.rst` file extension.

## Multiple outputs

The template supports output to multiple formats (called _builders_ in Sphinx). By default, only HTML-based builders are tested:

- html - from `features.md` creates `features.html`
- dirhtml - from `features.md` creates `features/index.html` making nicer URLs like (`features/`) because `index.html` is served automatically.
- singlehtml - all documents are in a single long HTML page

Builders are configured with {confval}`DEFAULT_BUILDER` and {confval}`BUILDERS` variables in `noxfile.py`.

## Preview

The template can launch a web server for local development, watch for document changes, rebuild HTML pages, and refresh a browser automatically.

See [preview task](#nox-preview).

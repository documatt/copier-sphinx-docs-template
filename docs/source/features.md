# Key Features

```{include} ../../README.md
:start-after: <!-- features -->
:end-before: <!-- .features -->
```

Some of features are described in more detail bellow.

## Mixing MD and RST

The template configures Sphinx to freely mix writting in Markdown and reStructuredText syntax. The detection is based on `.md` or `.rst` file extension.

## Multiple outputs

The template supports output to multiple formats (called _builders_ in Sphinx). By default, only HTML-based builders are tested:

- html - from `features.md` creates `features.html`
- dirhtml - from `features.md` creates `features/index.html` which makes nicer URLs like (`features/`) because `index.html` is served automatically.
- singlehtml - all documents are in single long HTML page

Builders are configured with {confval}`DEFAULT_BUILDER` and {confval}`BUILDERS` variables in `noxfile.py`.

## Preview

For local development, the template can launch webserver, watch for changes in documents, rebuild HTML pages and refresh a browser automatically.

See [preview task](#nox-preview).
